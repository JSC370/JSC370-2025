Integrated Surface Data provides a long-term record of hourly, sub-hourly and synoptic weather observations from station networks around the world. Observation sources include the World Meteorological Organization, Automated Surface Observing System, Automated Weather Observing Stations, US Climate Reference Network, and others. Weather elements observed include sky conditions, visibility, weather type, dry bulb, wet bulb, and dew point temperatures, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, wind gusts, station and sea level pressure, altimeter, and precipitation. Online data are typically delayed for 24 hours.

This dataset is a subset of all that data, in particular, contiguous US data only.
